In other databases, we would use commands such as; create, read, update, and delete. But with Redis we use different commands for
each function they include; SET, GET, and DEL. If you notice there is no command for an update, SET effectively updates a given
key with added information, so it works as an update and as an update as well as create. Something else that is beneficial about
Redis is that these commands are “Atomic” which means that commands are executed sequentially without any interference from other operations.

Pros

    High Performance: Redis operates in-memory, providing extremely fast data access.

    Versatility: Supports various data structures, which can simplify application logic.

    High Availability: Redis allows data to be copied to multiple instances so the system can remain available even if the master (main instance) fails

Cons

    Memory-Dependent: Since Redis stores data in memory, large datasets can require significant RAM.

    No Built-in Complex Querying: Lack of support for complex queries like SQL JOINs. As I mentioned above

    No Transactions: Redis does not support transactions, which can make it difficult to maintain data integrity.



Caching: Redis is ideal for caching due to its speed and ability to expire keys automatically.

Session Management: Redis’s fast access makes it perfect for storing session data in web applications.

Real-Time Analytics: The ability to handle high throughput makes Redis great for real-time data processing.



Redis seem decent at handling the data but the initial insert can take some time.

redis handles change in data much like inserting new data so if a lot needs to be changed at once and can take a little bit of time.
but if it is a small amount of data it is fairly fast.

Redis is designed to handle high volumes of requests efficiently due to its in-memory nature and atomic operations.

What strategies are available within Redis for scaling to solve these sort of problems?
we could use Redis Cluster, which is a distributed implementation of Redis that allows for sharding data across multiple Redis nodes.
This can help to distribute the load and improve performance.
